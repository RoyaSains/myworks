By analyzing ridership patterns, bus performance, and demographic indicators, it aims to enhance service efficiency and equity.\n\n\nSEPTA Ridership Recovery Post-Covid\nThis project analyzes SEPTA’s ridership recovery initiative, focusing on the relationship between socioeconomic characteristics, urban infrastructure, and public transit usage in Philadelphia, particularly bus services. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SEPTA launched a comprehensive ridership recovery program aimed at restoring full-service levels while ensuring passenger safety.\n\n\nShifting Skies: The Rise and Fall of Airlines Since 2013\nThis analysis explores shifts in air transport since 2013 using FAA Terminal Area Forecast data, identifying trends among major and minor airports. It highlights which airports have grown, stagnated, or declined over time.\n\n\nRising Economies of Leisure Airports Post-COVID\nThis analysis explores how major leisure-focused airports have evolved before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. These airports serve as key hubs for low-cost carriers catering to high-demand tourist routes. The study examines shifts in operations, recovery trends, and changing revenue structures in response to evolving travel patterns.",
